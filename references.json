Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167923694000412","DOI":"10.1016/0167-9236(94)00041-2","ISSN":"0167-9236","author":[{"family":"March","given":"Salvatore T."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Gerald F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,12,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,7]]},"container-title-short":"Decision Support Systems"},

However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external—conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","title-short":"Determinants of perceived ease of use","author":[{"family":"Venkatesh","given":"Viswanath"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]}},

The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested using longitudinal data collected regarding four different systems at four organizations (N = 156), two involving voluntary usage and two involving mandatory usage. Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40%–60% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34%–52% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance. These findings advance theory and contribute to the foundation for future research aimed at improving our understanding of user adoption behavior.","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926","DOI":"10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926","ISSN":"0025-1909","title-short":"A Theoretical Extension of the Technology Acceptance Model","author":[{"family":"Venkatesh","given":"Viswanath"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Fred D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,7]]},"container-title-short":"Management Science"},

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2017212.2017217","ISSN":"0276-7783","author":[{"family":"Hevner","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"March","given":"Salvatore T."},{"family":"Park","given":"Jinsoo"},{"family":"Ram","given":"Sudha"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,7]]}},
