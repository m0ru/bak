MVC programming is the application of a three-way factoring, whereby objects of different classes take over the operations related to the application domain, the display of the application's state, and the user interaction with the model and the view. We present several extended examples of MVC implementations and of the layout of composite application views. The Appendices provide reference materials for the Smalltalk-80 programmer wishing to understand and use MVC better within the Smalltalk-80 system.","author":[{"family":"Krasner","given":"Glenn E."},{"family":"Pope","given":"Stephen T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]}},

They are “wicked” problems, whereas science has developed to deal with “tame” problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about “optimal solutions” to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no “solutions” in the sense of definitive and objective answers.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730","DOI":"10.1007/BF01405730","ISSN":"0032-2687, 1573-0891","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Rittel","given":"Horst W.

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2017212.2017217","ISSN":"0276-7783","author":[{"family":"Hevner","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"March","given":"Salvatore T."},{"family":"Park","given":"Jinsoo"},{"family":"Ram","given":"Sudha"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,7]]}}
