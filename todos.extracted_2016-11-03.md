# Organisatorial

* **{** the meinkauf app! what did we use there? ionic and vanilla angular or ng-redux too? <!-- TODO get copy of mk repo --> **}**
* 02_problemdescription.md:![screens of latest prototype]() <!-- TODO -->

# Make Things (Visualisations, Code)

* 02_problemdescription.md:TODO image: dependency graph in angular application
* **{** compare examples of same process in old and new prototype (e.g. authoring and chatting (including unread?)) <!-- TODO pick examples and extract code --> **}**
* **{** <!-- TODO architecture graphics -->  **}**
* **{** graph out dependencies in both apps, if necessary in one vertical slice of one process <!-- TODO make graph of dependencies -->  **}**
* **{** code-examples of very simple apps with both architectures to demonstrate boiler-plate / overhead? Todo-MVC? <!-- TODO write examples -->  **}**

# Need Research / Googling

* **{** no-one did this with an rdfstore before, as far as I found out <!-- TODO re-research that to be up-to-date --> **}** (not that relevant as they're pretty disjunct)
* **{** where did we start with the changes/refactoring? i assume it was drafts/create-post or something like routing. <!-- TODO dive github versions --> **}**
* **{** in general: also list problems other people had / experiences other people in the community had (qualitative analysis?) <!-- TODO find posts --> **}**

# Open questions

* **{** number of bug tickets? hours logged spent bug-fixing? anecdotal evidence of how difficult it is/was <!-- TODO decide on metrics and gather data --> **}**
* { answer “is it worth the effort for my business?” } <!-- TODO talk this over with flo. can we find metrics for that? -->
* **{** analyze how well it interacts with the rest of the WoN-ecosystem. what defines "interacts well"? <!-- TODO ponder --> **}**
* **{** in what way is our current architecture better fitted? incl migration effort vs budget limits. what else might we want to try? <!-- TODO ponder --> **}**
* **{** compare to other architectures/setups <!-- TODO ponder --> **}**
* **{** when to and when not to use this architecture? it comes with a lot of overhead in setup, code and learning curve. e.g. for Quadex’s problem angular 2 was the better tool <!-- TODO ponder --> **}**
