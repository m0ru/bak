\section{Research Rigor}
``Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact.''
% This means applying existing foundations and methodologies, using effective metrics and formalising. Note, however, that an overemphasis on rigor can often lead to lower relevance (Lee 1999), as many environments and artifacts defy an excessive formalism (see ``wicked problems'' at footnote \ref{ref:wicked}). %TODO better reference / use glossary entry

## Process

<!--
Flo: "I think it's interesting to describe the actual process, but you should not over-emphasize it. In the end, you came up with a design and an implementation, and that is the artifact you produced.

If you can show multiple iterations of your artifact with 'experiments' evaluating its appropriateness and refinements, fine - but don't zoom into the microscopic level (first I read this, then that, ...).

"

**argument:** feasibility wasn't clear to begin with!!! -> it's research

1. peacemems notifies me of react
2. reading that, i also stumbled across flux
  * flux-article talks about problems with angular/bi-directional data-bindings resonates (same problems when debugging prev prototype) (?)
4. new ulf screens → we’ll need to rewrite (?)
4. rewriting with the old angular setup (angular 2 isn’t production ready)
4. pre-compilation (js, scss) and bundling setup
  * we also switched away from bootstrap, as we'd need to modify it’s styles that heavily anyway
4. actually: when stores and synching via the ws became a thing, started researching flux, ended up stumbling across redux (#342)
  * apparently, we were using flux even before that (see #342). it’s part of a commit from 23 Sep 2015 (1395ba6) and was only used to test with a draft store, so nvm.
  * and compared different implementations ( 	b824aa2)
6. read up on redux and ways to integrate with existing code-base
7. implementation
  * Frankangular - the Migration Process. Reducing angular to a rendering stage.
  * Frankangular - Duplicate imports :{
  * Migration:
      * Reducing bootstrap usage.
      * Promises: $q to native.
   * started with router and core reducers(?)
   * a lot of mocking → smooth collaboration
8. usability tests (?) not really part of architecture

* Meta: möglichst so, dass ich nichts mehr machen soll
* Meta: Write in a way that large parts can be used as WoN-documentation(?)
* Meta: always spell in full first names of female authors for references
* Meta: repeat important points with different wordings.

The Architecture fails somewhat at keeping sync state across tabs, implementing that is a lot of effort on top of it. Theoretically we could serialize and sync the entire state (making sync a lot easier than with angular and flux), but it’s still no Falcor, Relay or Meteor(?) in that regard.

“iteratively identifying deficiencies in prototypes and creatively developing solutions to address them” (Markus et al., 2002)

es6-includes make bundling a lot easier (no endless include lists in index.jsp anymore)

how did we migrate, step-by-step (central redux architecture first, then add components, write import wrapper for won.js, restructure linkeddata-service.js)

medium.js text field

rdfstore-js:

* use it for caching but not as redux store
* accessing it is asynch (reducers are synchronous)
* not all app data is described in rdf

compare with other architectures (angular 1.X, flux, cyclejs’ mvi, elm,...)

how did co-workers deal with it? ease of use?

interaction/integration with project mngmt workflows. e.g. pull-requests, mocking,...

more difficult architectural decisions:

* Routing
* Rdf-store
* Access Management
