what went well, what went badly:

- state-normalization changed; not flat anymore but prepared for comps
- build-change (webpack)
- still has probs due to lack of types (but easier to find the bugs)
- a lot of code ended up in action-creators
- "only stayed with angular because switching to redux was too much new stuff and too much code-base to throw away." (otherwise would have been react)

ask colleagues?
