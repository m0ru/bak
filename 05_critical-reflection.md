<!-- 

what went well, what went badly:

- state-normalization changed; not flat anymore but prepared for comps
- build-change (webpack)
- still has probs due to lack of types (but easier to find the bugs)
- a lot of code ended up in action-creators
- "only stayed with angular because switching to redux was too much new stuff and too much code-base to throw away." (otherwise would have been react)

This section will document in what ways our architecture diverges from or
builds on top of basic redux, as well as list experiences and
style-recommendations derived from using it. <!-TODO these latter points should be in the critical reflection section ->

ask colleagues?
